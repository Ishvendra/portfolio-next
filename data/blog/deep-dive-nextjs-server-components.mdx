# Deep Dive into Next.js Server Components

Server Components in Next.js mark a huge shift in how we think about rendering in React.  
Unlike traditional React components that run on the client, Server Components execute **only on the server**, never shipping their JavaScript to the client.

## Why does this matter?

- **Less JavaScript shipped** → Faster load times.
- **Improved data fetching** → Components can directly query databases or APIs without bundling client-side fetch logic.
- **Better caching** → Server-rendered output can be cached at the edge.

## Example

```tsx
// Example: a server component
export default async function BlogList() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts').then((res) => res.json());
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
This runs only on the server, so the client never sees fetch logic in the bundle.

Closing thoughts

Next.js Server Components represent a paradigm shift:
They allow React apps to scale better by reducing client-side complexity while improving performance.

Stay tuned for future articles where we’ll explore Partial Pre-rendering (PPR) and how it pairs beautifully with Server Components.
